The Luck Ones
A a website for a poembook I created.

To do:
-fix font sizes in header
-Fix the 15% error that's shifting the sizes on everything
-increase padding between the images
-fixing lines on the cards so they're all even
-update navbar to include logo and shift across entire screen
-restyle the cards to be scrollable and move across the page
-begin design for version 2.0
-Photo for design logo / maybe animation?
-Darkmode and light mode
-Make contact page work
-make mobile version
