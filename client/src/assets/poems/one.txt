You passed through my life like the Columbia eclipse, Bryson lights replaced by Brooklyn bulbs. 
You’re a juxtaposition, the epitome of confusion, you slink away as you wrap yourself around me. Perhaps the two are intertwined. 
While we do not speak in the same rhythms and tones any longer there are parts of us that have a language memorized. Half-truths of a half dead language. 
This is what it feels to let go of attachment. To become aware of golden days but only once they have been marked by the end of their era. You and I just linger at the back doors of each other’s lives and leave our nuisances in each other’s minds, the fraying remnants of memories, starving themselves for any semblance of connection. A bid for permission to wander in one day and beg you for your pardon, a sliver of attention, an excuse to stop by later, a once desperate but now shallow hope that you’d offer to take my coat. Invite me in. Ask me to stay a while. 
But the past hasn’t yet pardoned us and so we flow without ease, a disrupted disjointed disharmony. In and out, in and out and it will never cease to amaze me how connected we are in our separation.
