                            I'm Christina. I write code for a living and poetry to stay alive. I live in Philly now,
                            but most of my real living happens in the spaces between what I can say out loud and
                            what I have to write down.

                            <em>The Lucky Ones</em> started as the things I couldn't say to people's faces. The words
                            that came too late, the apologies that never got spoken, the love that got stuck in my throat.
                            It's the collection of moments when I was too afraid to be honest, so I wrote it down instead.
                        </p>

                            Each poem is paired with artwork because sometimes words aren't enough. Sometimes you need
                            to see the feeling, not just read about it. This is what it looks like when someone tries
                            to make sense of heartbreak, faith, and the mess of being human.

                            I don't have a process. I have moments when the words won't stay inside anymore.
                            I write them down, I paint what I can't say, and sometimes it makes sense later.
                            Most of the time it doesn't, but that's okay. The art isn't in having it figured outâ€”it's
                            in the trying.

                            trying to get it right.
